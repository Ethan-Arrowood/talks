# Ethan's Talks

This repo is a growing list of my conference and meetups talks. These talks also grow over time and you may find different versions of the same talk; its probably best to read/watch the latest of the set in that case ðŸ˜‰

Do **not** reuse my content without my permission. You are welcome to download, read, or reference my work at any time. If you want to present one of my talks you can request permission via [email](mailto:ethan@arrowood.dev). Keep in mind, many of my talks are available for free on YouTube.

If you would like me to speak at your event, send me an email at [ethan@arrowood.dev](mailto:ethan@arrowood.dev).
